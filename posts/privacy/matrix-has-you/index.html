It triggered me so much, and actually made me think how far down the rabbit hole with privacy (or should I say lack thereof) we are already.

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Internet remembers pretty much anything about you: what sites you visited, how often and when, how much time spent, where clicked, and where you were staring at. Almost pretty much every single company out there stores gigabytes of info on you, and for the right price they would sell it to anybody. But if we were to appoint one biggest culprit, it definitely would be Google:</p><ol><li>Google Chrome literelly has built-in trackers that log all your actions, location, IP address and then some more</li><li><a href=https://spreadprivacy.com/followed-by-ads/>A recent study</a> found that Google&rsquo;s trackers are installed in the vast majority of the sites worldwide</li><li>All their services track every single bit of your activity. <a href=https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity>Check out</a> what they have on you!</li><li><a href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johanmoreno/2021/08/27/google-estimated-to-be-paying-15-billion-to-remain-default-search-engine-on-safari/>Google pays dozens of billions of dollars</a> to remain default search engine on the iPhone and Mac. If paying Apple $15B seems reasonable to Google, chances are they&rsquo;re making much more off of the users&rsquo; information they gather</li><li>By the way, have you noticed how Google auto-suggests you while writing emails, and those suggestions are spot-on? I&rsquo;m curious how they&rsquo;d be able to do so <em><strong>without</strong></em> reading my mail</li><li>If it&rsquo;s not enoough, how about <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview?metric=users_accounts">Google disclosing your personal information</a> to authorities and lawyers, including for civil cases, too?!</li></ol><h2 id=gadgets>Gadgets

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Smart things are cool, smart devices and AI are making life easier, I agree. It&rsquo;s sad that there&rsquo;s a lot of strings attached:</p><ol><li>That Apple company, that put a lot of emphasis on privacy in their marketing in recent years, actually tracks you, even when you specifically told them not to do so!

How about those companies actually allowing humans to listen to those recordings in order to improve their products understanding capabilities. All of those big tech companies (Amazon, Apple, and Google) <a href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2019/07/30/confirmed-apple-caught-in-siri-privacy-scandal-let-contractors-listen-to-private-voice-recordings/>were caught doing so</a>, some of them even don&rsquo;t really anonymize the data, so that it can be traced back to the actual owner of the smart speaker ðŸ˜±</li></ol><h2 id=social-networks-and-messengers>Social Networks and Messengers

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>The third pillar of this &ldquo;Holy Trinity&rdquo; is definitely all those social apps that were intended to connect people around the world. Well, technically they do, but there&rsquo;s a lot of things their owners &ldquo;forgot&rdquo; to publicly disclose:</p><ol><li>Two most popular messengers, owned by Meta, are notorious users&rsquo; privacy offenders:<ul><li>Up to 2020 both Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp <a href=https://crambler.com/truth-about-facebook-messenger-app-privacy/>didn&rsquo;t use end-to-end ecnryption</a>, which means that any message sent on Messenger could be seen or intercepted in <strong>plain text</strong>.</li><li>Remember <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal>Cambridge Analytica</a>?

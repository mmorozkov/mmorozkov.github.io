I am a manager with a solid engineering background: last 15+ years I spent either writing software or helping tech teams do so. Transition into management is usually a bumpy road, but to me it proved to be a blessing, as I enjoy working with my teams and getting things done together as never before, and it also pays back with never-ending source of unique puzzles.

I am currently working as a Head of Delivery Unit at Devexperts from my home office in St. Petersburg, Russia. Most of my working principles are well stated in my [Manager's ReadMe][1].

This blog is a place for me to reflect on things and share the ones I find most peculiar and important, mostly around engineering & management. Every now and then, I'm writing on casual topics.

The opinions stated here are entirely of my own.

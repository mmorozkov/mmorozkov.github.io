Recently, I caught a cold and was lying in bed with flu symptoms, being bored to death. Who knows why, I decided to rewatch Game of Thrones, and 10 minutes in, I started noticing that I was unwittingly, but inherently spotting how main characters were primarily unable to solve what seemed to be typical management cases they were presented with. As if knowing the plot and each character’s path, led my brain cells to exercise a bit. So follow me on this rant about the most egregious management anti-patterns and fails of the season 1 of the show.

## Conflict Resolution

*Or let’s hug and do nothing according to **Robert Baratheon***

The king is presented twice with pretty same conflict situations: his wife and his best friend having completely different views. First, it’s a direwolf biting prince’s Joffrey when he wanted to swing a sword at Arya Stark. Second time, it’s Jaime Lannister killing Ned’s Stark people. And both times the resolution was… do nothing! The king listens to both parties and instead of making a judgement, decides to get away from really defusing the situation, saying something along the lines of let’s forget previous problems and move on.

## Leadership

*Or I’m your boss, you should do what I say, according to **Viserys Targaryen***

Just look at this attention seeking and screaming boy craving for power! He’s achieved literally nothing in his whole life, but still there he is demanding everyone bowing before him. There’s no future for such self-proclaimed leaders, who can only demand. As Lord Commander said to Jon Snow “You want to lead on day. Then learn how to follow”, this is what leadership is all about.

## Team Building

*Or hey new engineer, go rework our prod architecture as your first assignment, according to **Daenerys Targaryen***

So here’s the deal: the dothraki army is killing civilians, and then Daenerys arrives on a white horse and says to stop. And immediately falls for an advice of a random witch who happens to speak the common language.

I’m really perplexed how people and organizations look for and fall for a savior - someone who comes one day and shows **the way** immediately. There’s no way a person with zero context can account for all the nuances an org has accumulated throughout the years, so that they can really steer the ship quickly!

## Vision

*Or we’re doing things right (of course, instead of doing the right things), according to **Ned Stark***

Pretty much everything that Ned does, he does right. And with honor. Unfortunately, he never thinks of what would be the right thing to do instead, even when he’s asked directly by the council members shortly before the king’s death. Here’s a short list of the things done right:

1. Didn’t tell anybody about Jon’s parents → not disclosing information, to “keep” the team safe
2. Prompted the queen to flee with children → covering up for someone for no reason
3. Confesses in the treason to save daughters → lying to the client now, hoping to fix it later

## Silver Lining

Good lord, it’s an irony that in the absolute management mess of Westeros, the most sane, stable and adequate leader is on the Wall. No, it’s not Jon (yet), it’s **Jeor Mormont**, the Lord Commander. Disagree?

Bear with me on this one. He’s building the Night Watch out of burglars, rapists and murderers - they call it limited time and budget nowadays - and he is well aware of what and who he’s dealing with, thus he spots great people and helps them succeed mentoring and sponsoring them. Moreover, he lets the people fail and learn from that (remember, when Jon wanted to abandon his vows and left the Black Castle?). And unlike Ned Stark, he’s indeed thinking what’s the right thing to do and proactively wants to figure out what’s happening to the north of the Wall.

Well, you could say, look how and where he ended up - killed by his own people. Luckily for me, it’s in season 2, and by the way, I’m not a big proponent of results oriented thinking - one can fail, even if they did the right things and did it right. What’s more important, is maximizing the EV.
